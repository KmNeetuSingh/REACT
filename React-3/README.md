# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Definitely!The commented out part of the below section would create a [check] advance form handling using the `useRef` hook in React.

This piece of work deals with the modern handling of forms in React with a special focus on commendable work of the `useRef` hook, which is one of the most intriguing features in the catalog of this framework. Form management is within the implementation scope and allows the system to react, e. g. , the input focus is changeable in real-time, input validation is in real-time as well and form submission handling can be structured as desired.
 

 
`useRef` hook helps to input over the form element for the creation of a robust focus managment system that is supposed to work when the elements of the form are being handled based on interaction from the user. The `useRef` reference (nameRef, emailRef, passwordRef) for each input field serves this purpose. When navigating through the fields, focus can be transitioned many different ways that include usings a keyboard ‘tab’ or ‘click’, which is just like touch screen devices/mouse click.
 

 
More about real-time input validation is bought because of the `validateInput` function that validates input values according to the validation rules and provides error messages through the `by rules`. In general, the listed way to build the country selection form speeds up the user experience since the form validity is judged on input immediately and the data integrity is made prior to the future form submission.
 

 
The data in the custom form is speedily submitted over the `handleSubmit` function that caters to this process and routes and runs validation checks. When there are no errors the data is being logged; but if there are then the submission is banned and messages of the errors show up.
 

 
I will put down lessons I gained from this task among which are, in the first place, use of `useRef` makes the handling more higher level and, in the second place, it is necessary to provide immediate feedback for input validation and, finally, allowing DOM manipulation directly makes form interactions much easier. Despite the relative briefness and emphasis on React, the end of the project termed me to see more worlds for react in thesatisfying this field and the broadening of my capacity to bring forth strong and user-friendly applications for the web.
