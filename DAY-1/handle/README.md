# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.Sure! Here is a concise paragraph reflecting the observations and learnings from the assignment, written from the perspective of an aspiring developer:

Completing this assignment on handling side effects in React using the `useEffect` hook has been an enlightening journey. Initially, I found the concept of side effects in React challenging, as I primarily viewed components as tools for rendering UI. However, this task helped me understand the critical role side effects play, such as fetching data, manipulating the DOM, and subscribing to events. Implementing these effects using the `useEffect` hook showcased how it replaces traditional lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`, and emphasized the importance of proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks. The process of managing asynchronous operations, such as API fetching, and dynamically updating the document title based on component state, provided hands-on experience in handling real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the challenge of managing the dependencies array in `useEffect` taught me to ensure the correct execution of side effects without causing unnecessary re-renders or missing updates. Overall, this assignment has significantly deepened my understanding of React's capabilities and best practices, leaving me more confident in building dynamic, efficient, and responsive React applications.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
